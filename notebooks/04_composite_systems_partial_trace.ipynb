    "# Composite systems & Reduced density matrices\n",
    "Single qubit states and general isolated physical systems are very convenient theoretical tool, however in reality, it's almost impossible to get a perfectly isolated system. System might ineract with other particles or dissipate some energy to surrounding. Moreover, single particle system descriptions are often incomplete, since they do not account for intristic degrees of freedom of particle. All above creates demand in formulating theoretical formalism for composite systems and respective subsystems.\n"

    "## Composite systems\n",
    "**Fifth axiom of quantum mechanics:** \"If the Hilbert space of system $A$ is $\\mathcal{H}_A$ and the Hilbert space of system $B$ is $\\mathcal{H}_B$, then the Hilbert space of the composite systems $AB$ is the tensor product $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$. If system $A$ is prepared in the state $\\ket{\\psi}_A$ and system $B$ is prepared in the state $\\ket{\\phi}_B$, then the composite system’s state is the product $\\ket{\\psi}_A \\otimes \\ket{\\phi}_B$\"[1]. So if $\\{\\ket{i }_A\\}$ is a orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_A$ and ${\\ket{\\mu }_B}$ for $\\mathcal{H}_B$, then states $\\ket{i,\\mu}_{AB} = \\ket{i}_A \\otimes \\ket{\\mu}_B$ are a basis for composite system. We can also define operators on composite states. Let $\\ket{i,\\mu}_{AB} \\in \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$, then operator $M_A\\otimes N_B$ acts on it as follows $(M_A\\otimes N_B)\\ket{i, \\mu}_{AB} = M_A\\ket{i}_A\\otimes N_B\\ket{\\mu}_B$. This means that we can act on part of composite system by applying the required operator to that system and applying identity to the second system.  $M_A \\otimes I$ acts on system $A$ with $M_A$ and leaves second system untouched. Similarly $I\\otimes N_B$ acts on system $B$ with $N_B$ and leaves $A$ as it is. All above can be extended for multipartite systems. Suppose we are given n Hilbert spaces and let $\\mathcal{H}_i, i \\in(1,...,n)$ be Hilbert space of $i^{th}$ system prepared in state $\\ket{\\psi}_i$, then the composite system is $\\mathcal{H}_1 \\otimes\\mathcal{H}_2\\otimes...\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_n$ and it's state is $\\ket{\\psi}_1\\otimes\\ket{\\psi}_2\\otimes...\\otimes \\ket{\\psi}_n$.\n",
    "Composite systems can also be introduced for mixed states. If we have n systems with $i^{th}$ system being in state $\\rho_i$ then the composite system is in state $\\rho_1\\otimes \\rho_2\\otimes...\\otimes\\rho_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "General state in composite system $\\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$ can be written as $\\ket{\\psi} = \\sum_{i,\\mu}c_{i,\\mu}\\ket{i, \\mu}_{AB}$. When system can be written as a single tensor product $\\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\phi}_A\\ket{\\phi}_B$ it's called product state. This distinction is very imortant physically, since it is closely related with entanglement. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Entanglement\n",
    "First discovered by Einstein in 1931, entaglement is a quantum phenomena wherein particles that are separated by distance cannot be described independently. Conversely, knowing some information about one subsystem, we gain information about other one. It can be seen as an independent information resource in quantum information, which gives rise to various quantum algorithms (quantum teleportation, quantum parallelism). \n",
    "\n",
    "Comsider a composite system $\\mathcal{H}_1\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_2$ in state $\\rho$. We say the system is separable if and only if there exist $\\{{\\rho_1^k}\\}$ and $\\{\\rho{_2^k}\\}$ states in subsystems such that $\\rho = \\sum_{k}p_k\\rho_1^k\\otimes\\rho_2^k$ with $p_k \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{k}p_k = 1$. Otherwise system is entangled. For pure states, pure state is separable if and only if it is a product state. When two states become entangled that means that the coherence between them is destroyed and one subsystem can't be no longer described alone. In other words, subsystem becomes a mixed state even if the system as a whole is pure.\n",

    "## Partial trace\n",
    "When considering subsystems of composite systems reduced density operators are defined. For a composite system $\\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_B$ in  a state $\\rho^{AB}$, the reduced state $\\rho^A$ for system A is $\\rho^A = tr_B(\\rho^{AB})$. $tr_B$ is called partial trace over system $B$, defined as $tr_B(\\rho^A\\otimes\\rho^B) = \\rho^Atr(\\rho^B)$. Partial trace is used because it preserves the measurement statistics when measurement is performed on system A. Moreover partial trace is the only such function. Tracing out a subsystem traces out all degrees of freedom associated with that subsystem. So, we can treat the traced out subsystem as environment or a system we do not have access to. For product states $\\rho\\otimes\\sigma$ reduced density operator just simplifies to $\\rho_A = tr_B(\\rho\\otimes\\sigma) = \\rho tr(\\sigma) = \\rho$.\n",

    "Partial trace on  first system gave a pure subsystem. This state has neither entanglement or classical uncertainty. This result can be generalised to a propsition: State $\\ket{psi}$ of composite system $AB$ is a product state if and only if $\\rho^{A}$ (and thus $\\rho^{B}$) is a pure state[1]. Second result is a classical result in quantum information. A pure Bell system that is highly entangled has maximally mixed reduced state (Bloch vector $r = 0$). Although no classical uncertainty is involved in this state. Entanglement implies that the state of a subsystem cannot, in general, be described by a state vector. The reduced state of rho1 state is maximally mixed, due to classical uncertainty involved in the global state.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Composite systems framework introduces correlations that can't be understand from single particle systems. It broads our understanding of single particle systems, quantifying intristic degrees of freedom. It allows us to describe entanglement - information resource that is unique for quantum information. And it been shown in this notebook how entanglement leads to locally mixed states. But maybe the most important application of composite systems is the mathematical description of open systems. Indeed, if we consider a composite system and treat it as an closed system then we can think of first subsystem as a open system and second subsystem as environment. This methodology gives rise for description of noisy quantum channels and decoherence in quantum information theory."
