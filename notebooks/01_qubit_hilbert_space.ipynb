Indeed, if we choose an ordered basis for our Hilbert state, we can represent vectors of that space as column vectors (known as \"ket\" vectors). Moreover, we can represent dual space vectors as row vectors (known as \"bra\" vectors)."

QuTip library is a powerful tool, that naturally represents and implements quantum systems for numerical and computational analysis on classical computers."
