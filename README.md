# Foundations of Quantum Computing
This repository contains series of Jupyter notebooks that explore quantum mechanics using QuTip library for python. The notebooks are mainly focused on mathematical structure, physical interpretation and relevance to quantum information theory and computing. 
## Notebooks overview
1. **Qubits & Hilbert space** - mathematical framework for single particle systems, Hilbert spaces, axioms of quantum mechanics.
2. **Unitary Time Evolution & Bloch Sphere** -
3. **Density Matrices & Mixed States** - 
4. **Composite Systems & Partial Trace** -
