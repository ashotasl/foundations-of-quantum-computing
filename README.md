# Foundations of Quantum Computing
This repository contains series of Jupyter notebooks that explore quantum mechanics using QuTip library for python. The notebooks are mainly focused on mathematical structure, physical interpretation and relevance to quantum information theory and computing. 
## Notebooks overview
1. **Qubits & Hilbert space** - mathematical framework for single particle systems, Hilbert spaces, axioms of quantum mechanics.
2. **Unitary Time Evolution & Bloch Sphere** - Dynamics of closed systems, SU(2) rotations and geometric representation of qubits.
3. **Density Matrices & Mixed States** - Decoherence, purity and classical uncertainty.
4. **Composite Systems & Partial Trace** - Entanglement,  reduced states,  subsystems. 
## Skills demonstrated 
-Linear algebra on Hilbert spaces
- Quantum dynamics and open quantum systems
- Entanglement and tensor product structure
- Numerical simulation of quantum systems


This project is intended for students and researchers interested in quantum computing, quantum information, and the theoretical foundations of quantum mechanics.
